/// @note For simplicity of use, and because communication with the devices isn't very stable, the engine doesn't allow for direct control of the devices.
///
/// The behaviour of the endgine is as follow:
/// 1. On `start()` the device parsers are started and scout for connected acquisition
/// devices.
/// 2. Upon finding a device, the parser opens a connection, and open a connection
/// with it.
/// 3. The parser notifies the engine of the new device, which creates a Tracker with it.
/// 4. The tracker handles the pose estimation mechanisms and pass along every detected bodies.
///
/// Bodies of the same ID are about the same person on the same device.
